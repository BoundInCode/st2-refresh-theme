# Pseudo OSX theme
**OS X UI theme for Sublime Text 2**
![Pseudo OSX theme](https://github.com/raik/st2-pseudo-osx-theme/raw/master/screenshot.png)

The theme is largely based on the excellent [Soda theme by Ian Hill](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme).

Scrollbars are from the default theme.

So I mainly didn't do anything.

## Installation

For now you can download or clone it from here... if someone founds this theme useful I could try to put it on Package Control

### Manually downloading
Rename the folder to `Theme - Pseudo OSX` and put it in your `Packages` directory

### Activating

In your Settings - User file:

    {
        "theme": "Pseudo OSX.sublime-theme"
    }

## TODO *(maybe)*

* Search icons need some reconsidering
* New scrollbars
